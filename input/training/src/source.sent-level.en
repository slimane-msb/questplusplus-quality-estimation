The Nanterre tribunal decided on Friday to bring François-Marie Banier to trial to ascertain whether, as the daughter of billionairess Liliane Bettencourt is accusing him, he profited from the eighty-year-old's weakened mental state to despoil her of some of her fortune.
The photographer, 62, known for his photographs of the stars, will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for "abuse of weakness", an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro fine.
The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case, which is turning into a worthy family saga involving one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are torn apart, while at the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
In the letter dated from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years."

They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence.

Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster is able to present his successor.
Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the appointment.
Roland Koch, the prime minister of Hesse, had organised the opposition to the editor-in-chief.
With the argument that ZDF's news broadcasts had lost viewers under Brender, he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the exercising of political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
He later worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the heute-journal.
Subsequent activities: From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor-in-chief; in 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the Morgenmagazin; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign affairs; then head of the ZDF head studio.

For Klitchko this was his third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008.

The monthly service price, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection)to check their mail.

Injuries impede Unicaja's fight
Unicaja lost miserably in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave them the lead in Group B of the Euroleague in a game marked by the loss of the cajistas, especially in the inside game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory.
Despite all the problems, because of Cook's control and three-pointers, and Lewis' assists, Unicaja had some hope left with the score at 66-57 in the 31st minute.
